The first project, as per curriculum, is focused on making a mini-website that displays a few recipes to the users.
I will do my best to implement all the skills I have learned so far - nothing less and nothing more. :)

DISCLAIMER: I am NOT the author of the recipes and of the linked images. The sections Descriptions, Ingredients and Steps were sourced from other websites (detailed source given in the comment in the respective recipe HTML documents) - these were at best reworded by me. Information in the paragraph provided in index.html sourced from a book (detailed source given in the comment of the document).
