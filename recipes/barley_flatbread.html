        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Barley was the most commonly grown grain in Sweden in Denmark. 
            Occasionally archaeologists find the remains of cereal grains or bread survive from Viking Age sites, such as the bread from Birka. 
            Mostly cereals which have been burnt and carbonized survive in the archaeological record, to be discovered a millennium later.
            Hulled barley was used for thin, flat bread, baked on an open fire.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups barley flour</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Blend ingredients together until a stiff dough is formed. Warm a griddle over a fire (or you can use a cooking sheet in the oven);</li>
            <li>Take a heavy rolling-pin and take a ball the size of a walnut and roll the ball until flattened;</li>
            <li>Roll outward so that it is as thin as you can until you have a flat, round disk;</li>
            <li>Lay it on the griddle and and place it over the fire (or cook at high heat in the oven) about 30 seconds on either side;</li>
            <li>One flat loaf at a time, roll out the dough and cook (it is most efficient to have two people, one rolling dough and one cooking flat loaves).</li>
        </ol>
