        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Most of the barley grown would have been used to make ale. The remainder was used for bread and other dishes. 
            Porridge or gruel made from whole or cracked grains was an important everyday food for the Viking farm family and it is believed that it was the 
            staple food of the Viking Age. During the week the grain for the porridge would be simply cooked in water and then eaten. 
            At celebrations porridge would be cooked with milk and eaten with butter.
