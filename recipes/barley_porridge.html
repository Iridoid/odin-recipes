        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>There are two ways to serve porridge. The first is what Americans would consider "hot breakfast cereal" style. For this type of porridge, about 15 to 20 
            minutes before the porridge is done, add a cup of chopped fruit, such as apples, pears, rose hips, etc., then serve with fresh cream and some butter on 
            top. Any left-overs may be pressed into a buttered mold and chilled for storage a day or two, then sliced, fried in butter, and served with either a hot 
            fruit compote, or with butter and jam.
        </p>

            Another way to serve porridge is to make it a savory dish. The Poetic Edda mentions the god Þórr eating porridge with herring in it. I've had good results 
            adding chopped chicken, veal, or pork. The meat should be added to the porridge early enough in the cooking process so that it is cooked thoroughly. 
            For fish, this will be closer to the end than it will be for the various meats. You can also add garlic, onion, and other herbs and spices. This makes 
            a hearty, filling dish.
