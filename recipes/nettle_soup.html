        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Nässelsoppa is a well-known sign of spring in Sweden with hard-boiled eggs and crème fraîche as traditional accompaniments. 
            Packed with nutrition and flavour, nettles have high quantities of iron, calcium, vitamin A and K. 
            In medieval Europe they were used medicinally as a diuretic and to treat joint pain. Early nettles are tender and perfect for cooking.
