        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Nässelsoppa is a well-known sign of spring in Sweden with hard-boiled eggs and crème fraîche as traditional accompaniments. 
            Packed with nutrition and flavour, nettles have high quantities of iron, calcium, vitamin A and K. 
            In medieval Europe they were used medicinally as a diuretic and to treat joint pain. Early nettles are tender and perfect for cooking.

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>In a large pan, heat the oil and then sauté the onion for about 5 minutes, until soft without colouring.</li>
            <li>Add the water, salt, stock, dried thyme and a good pinch of white pepper. Bring to the boil and then add the nettles. Cover and leave to simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whizz the soup in a food processor (or use a hand blender) until smooth and then return to the pan.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the corn flour (cornstarch) in a little water and stir it into the soup.</li>
            <li>Bring back to a gentle boil, stirring regularly until the soup thickens slightly. Check and adjust the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with halved hard-boiled eggs and a dollop of crème fraîche.</li>
